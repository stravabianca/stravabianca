Here are some ideas to get you started:

As a setup we use Visual Studio Code to work on Front-End and Visual Studio for the back-end stuff, SQL Management Studio for databases.

For any work that you do use the Browser Debugger Tools, there you will see error in the console.

Javascript reliable source: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript

Usefull to do some practical exercises are this sites: https://nodeschool.io/
